    "1 Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "ANS- \n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows a class (also known as the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (i.e., data and methods) from another class (also known as the superclass or base class). The subclass is said to be an \"extension\" of the superclass because it can reuse and build upon the features defined in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance creates an \"is-a\" relationship between classes. It means that the subclass is a specialized version of the superclass. This enables developers to model real-world relationships and hierarchies effectively. For instance, consider a superclass called Vehicle that contains properties like color, weight, and methods like start(), stop(). We can then have subclasses like Car, Bike, and Truck, which inherit the properties and methods from the Vehicle class but may have additional specific properties and methods unique to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of inheritance in OOP:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance allows the subclass to inherit the code from the superclass. This reduces code duplication, promotes code reuse, and makes the codebase more maintainable and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Subclasses can add new features or override existing behaviors inherited from the superclass. This allows the developers to customize the behavior of a class without modifying the original class, promoting the \"Open-Closed Principle\" of software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Since subclasses can be treated as their superclass, polymorphism is achieved. This means that objects of different subclasses can be used interchangeably if they share a common superclass, which facilitates flexibility and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Organization: Inheritance facilitates the creation of hierarchical class structures, which closely resemble the natural relationships between entities in many systems.\n",
    "\n",
